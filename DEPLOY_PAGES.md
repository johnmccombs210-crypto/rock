Deploying this project to Cloudflare Pages

1) Build the static site

```
npm install
npm run build
```

2) Publish with Wrangler Pages

Replace `<project-name>` with a Pages project name (or omit to let Pages infer):

```
npx wrangler pages publish dist --project-name=<project-name>
```

3) What the repo now contains

- `index.html` — static UI. The UI calls `/api/proxy`.
- `functions/proxy.js` — Cloudflare Pages Function that proxies requests to the target site.
- `dist/` — generated by `npm run build` and published to Pages.

Notes and safety
- This repository intentionally does NOT include features intended to evade network filters, censorship, or other access controls. It implements a basic proxying function suitable for legitimate use-cases like privacy-preserving testing and content transformation.
- Adjust CORS and rate-limiting in `functions/proxy.js` to meet your needs and policies.
